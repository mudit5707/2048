# 2048
The classic mathematical game integrated into a lovely Python Code

A simple command-line version of the classic 2048 puzzle game, built entirely in Python!

This project simulates the core mechanics of 2048 — merging tiles, shifting in four directions, and generating new tiles — all through clean, beginner-friendly logic.

🎮 Features

Fully functional 2048 grid mechanics (merge, shift, spawn).

Supports Up, Down, Left, Right movements.

Random tile generation (2s and 4s).

Clear grid printing for terminal play.

Easy-to-read and well-structured Python logic.

🧠 How It Works

The game uses:

A 4×4 matrix to represent the board.

Movement functions (MoveUp, MoveDown, etc.) that push and merge tiles.

Logic that prevents multiple merges in one move.

Random tile spawning after every valid move.
